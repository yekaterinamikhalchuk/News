post_text1 = 'Small businesses that weathered the last two years face a new challenge: rising inflation. According ' \
             'to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the all-items index rose ' \
             '7.0 percent for the 12 months ending December ' \
             '2021—the highest increase in 40 years. \n' \
             'Steps That May Help Your Business Address Inflation.' \
             'Key insights from small business owners reveal steps you can take that may be able to ease ' \
             'inflations effect on your business. \n' \
             '1. Streamline and automate processes. \n' \
             'Stefani found that reorganizing his companys warehouse saved money. We invested 5,000 ' \
             'in new shelving. After installations, we found it nearly doubled productivity. Improving ' \
             'processes may mean exploring automation for your company, suggests Ben Johnston, ' \
             'COO of Kapitus, a provider of growth capital to small businesses. As the cost of labor continues ' \
             'to climb, re-examine processes, ' \
             'he advises. Could time-intensive work be automated? Is there software that can be deployed ' \
             'to automate business processes like scheduling, ' \
             'order taking, billing or collecting payments? Is robotic processing ' \
             'an opportunity when manufacturing a good or completing a repetitive task? \n' \
             '2. Analyze profit margins. \n' \
             'Examine your profit margins carefully, ' \
             'says Sam Barrante, an e-commerce entrepreneur. Start by re-evaluating your costs ' \
             'and then analyze what margins you are facing in todays economy. ' \
             'From there, start looking into solutions to increase those margins, while continuing to ' \
             'ensure quality products and services. ' \
             '3. Improve productivity. \n' \
             'The more quickly and efficiently you and your employees work, the higher your profit margins are ' \
             'likely to be. Use technologies and apps that track and improve productivity, ' \
             'says Cassel.\n' \
             '4. Cut expenses when and where possible.Reduce wherever you can, advises ' \
             'Bradley Katz, CEO and co-founder of Axon Optics, a therapeutic eyewear provider.  ' \
             'Consider downsizing your office,  says Katz.  For example, my business uses a hybrid ' \
             'remote/in-office model that allows the flexibility to move to a smaller, ' \
             'less expensive office. Also check if your company is paying for products or services that arent ' \
             'being used and cancel those items. Also consider substituting materials. ' \
             'You may find alternate products or ingredients that will save you money.\n' \
             '5. Stock up on supplies now.\n' \
             'Evan McCarthy has helped to insulate his company against inflation ' \
             'while also addressing supply chain issues by stocking up on core materials. We reorganized our ' \
             'warehouse and now have pallets full of supplies reaching to the ceiling ' \
             'in the 10,000-square-foot space,  says McCarthy, the president of Sporting Smiles, which' \
             ' provides custom dental products.  We stocked up, because every time we ' \
             'ordered supplies, the price kept rising. Our cardboard box supplies had ' \
             'three major increases in 2021. Also consider renegotiating contracts with suppliers ' \
             'and buying large equipment now, as prices are likely to increase.\n' \
             '6. Raise prices judiciously. \n' \
             'While raising prices isnt ideal, it may be ' \
             'helpful in combatting inflations effect on your business. Avoid turning off ' \
             'customers with dramatic across-the-board price increases. ' \
             'Instead, raise prices slowly in modest increments and be strategic. Choose ' \
             'areas where customers are less likely to notice.\n' \
             '7. Be ready for new customers. \n ' \
             'Inflation automatically creates new customer segments, so go after them,  ' \
             'suggests Stuart Robles, a partner at Briggs Capital, a mergers and acquisitions ' \
             'firm for small and medium-sized businesses, and co-author of The New World ' \
             'of Entrepreneurship: Insiders Guide to Buying and Selling Your Own Business ' \
             'in the Digital Age. Inflationary periods are unnerving to many,  says Robles.  ' \
             'As a result, customer segments and market niches previously unreachable can become ' \
             'attainable as your company is seen as a beacon of light in terms of potential ' \
             'lower prices and rates. The information contained herein is for generalized ' \
